# Molecular Classification of Cancer by Gene Expression Monitoring â€¢ Machine Learning
Trained a model to identify cancer classes and classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Preprocessed the data to extract meaningful features using numpy and pandas, reduced the dimension using PCA from 7128 gene features to 30, applied neural network to train the classification model and cross validation to estimate the accuracy.
